      <h3>Number 1: Grill Spot Curly Fries</h3>
      <p>The Curly Fries at Grill spot are easily the best fries availible to student on campus. They're seasoned to perfection, and have the perfect ration of crunchy to soft. Plus, they come in a fun shape!</p>
      <p>The only problem is that grill spot doesn't always have these fries availible--they only show "fries" on they're menu, and there's no way to tell what kind of fries you're going to get.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <h3>Number 2: Chick-Fill-A waffle fries</h3>
      <p>Out of all the places on campus, Chick-Fill-A has the most consitent frie quality. At grill spot, ordering fries can be a gamble, but at Chick-Fill-A, you know exactly what you're going to get. The fries are plainer than grill Spot Curly fries, but some may prefer this. Plus, they come in a fun Shape!</p>
      <p>All around, if you just want some fries without having to worry about what you're going to get, Chick-Fill-A is a solid option</p>

        <div class="col-sm-6">
      <h3>Number 3: Grill Spot Shoelace Fries</h3>
      <p>Grill Spots sgoelace fries, when done correctly, easily Rivel Waffle Fries and even Curly fries, but unfortunately, of all the fry choices, these are the least consistent. While sometimes they are exeptional, other times they're just a mouthful of bland starch</p>
      <p>When Grill Spot has Shoelace fries, go ahead and order them--just be aware of the risks.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <h3>Number 4: Grill Spot Regular Fries</h3>
      <p>These fries are most often served at the Evans Commans Grill Spot location. They offer A more traditional fry experience, but unfortunately are a bit lackluster, suffering from a lack of flavor and from being a bit heavy on the stomach.</p>
      <p>If you just want "normal" french fries, give these a shot. Otherwise, go ahead and choose one of the other options on this list</p>
