      <h3>Number 1: Grill Spot Curly Fries</h3>
      <p>The Curly Fries at Grill spot are easily the best fries availible to students on campus. They're seasoned to perfection, and have an exquisite ratio of crunchy to soft. Plus, they come in a fun shape!</p>
      <p>The only problem is that grill spot doesn't always have these fries availible--they only show "fries" on their menu, and there's no way to tell what kind of fries you're going to get.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <h3>Number 2: Chick-Fill-A waffle fries</h3>
      <p>Out of all the places on campus, Chick-Fill-A has the most consitent frie quality. At grill spot, ordering fries can be a gamble, but at Chick-Fill-A, you know exactly what you're going to get. The fries are plainer than Grill Spot's curly fries, but some may prefer that. Plus, they come in a fun Shape!</p>
      <p>All around, if you just want some fries without having to worry about what you're going to get, Chick-Fill-A is a solid option</p>
    </div>
    


    
        <div class="col-sm-6">
      <h3>Number 3: Grill Spot Shoelace Fries</h3>
      <p>Grill Spot's shoelace fries, when done correctly, easily rival Chick-Fill-A's waffle fries and even Grill Spots own curly fries, but unfortunately, of all the fry choices, these are the least consistent. While sometimes they are exeptional, other times they're just a mouthful of bland starch</p>
      <p>When Grill Spot has Shoelace fries, go ahead and order them--just be aware of the risks.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <h3>Number 4: Grill Spot Regular Fries</h3>
      <p>These fries are rarely served at the spellman center Grill Spot location, so if you'd like to get these, you'll most likely have to head to Evans Commons. They offer a more traditional fry experience, but unfortunately are a bit lackluster, suffering from a flat flavor profile and from being a bit heavy on the stomach.</p>
      <p>If you just want "normal" french fries, give these a shot. Otherwise, go ahead and choose one of the other options on this list</p>
